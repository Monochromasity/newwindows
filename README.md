Hello! If you are reading this, then that means you must be using the TW/PM Extension Template! Let me provide you with some information.

THIS TEMPLATE LETS YOU CREATE EXTENSIONS FOR ANY MODIFICATION OF SCRATCH, INCLUDING PENGUINMOD (penguinmod.com)

Make sure to press "Use this template" to make your own extensions, then export your preferred extension.js file and make pull requests for the TurboWarp or PenguinMod Extension Galleries to get your extension added. Alternatively, you can make a pull request on the Scrandled GitHub page.

:::: SANDBOXED v UNSANDBOXED ::::

You may have noticed that there are two of "extension.js": sandboxed and unsandboxed.

For more information on what the sandbox is, visit: https://docs.turbowarp.org/development/extensions/sandbox

It is highly recommended that you do one of the following so that you can test your extension in TurboWarp:

---- Export your preferred extension.js file and go to https://turbowarp.org/editor, then click Add Extension, then TurboWarp, then Custom Extension, then File, then upload your extension.js file, and tick "Run extension without sandbox" if required.

---- Copy your extension code (all of it!) from your preferred extension.js file and go to https://turbowarp.org/editor, then click Add Extension, then TurboWarp, then Custom Extension, then Text, then paste the extension code into the text box, and tick "Run extension without sandbox" if required.

The UNSANDBOXED version of extension.js has added code to "[SANDBOXED] extension.js" to make it run without the sandbox, letting it access Scratch internals and all that stuff.

If you want to learn more about creating your own TurboWarp extension, I suggest reading the official documentation on it: https://docs.turbowarp.org/development/extensions/introduction

Both the unsandboxed and sandboxed versions of extension.js are set to a default example extension, which does function in TurboWarp, but is not recommended to use in TurboWarp projects as they are only intended for display use in the GitHub editor.

You are free to release whatever extensions you make by sending a pull request to either the TurboWarp Extension Gallery, PenguinMod Extension Gallery or the Scrandled GitHub page.

Thanks for reading this information.
